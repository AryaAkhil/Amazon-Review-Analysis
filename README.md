## Summary

### Keywords: 
Amazon reviews, Sentiment Analysis.

### Language:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Major Packages: 
pandas, textblob, nltk, vader

### Overview
This project aims to analyse sentiments of Amazon reviewers against 50 products in each of following 3 product lines - phones, consoles and cameras betweenn 2006 and 2018.
Furthermore, it tries to measure percentage of positive, negative and neutral sentiments against specific features and showcase it as a Tableau dashboard - 
[Amazon Sentiment Analyzer](https://public.tableau.com/profile/arya4413#!/vizhome/ReviewAnlayzerTool/ExecutiveSummary).
The jupyter notebook attached with this project doesn't covers the textual data cleaning as I have covered that comprehensively as part of a separate project that can be found on profile in the name of - "Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data". 
Rather, user will be able to use the notebook to directly perform sentiment analysis on cleaned data.

### Data Source
The data was extracted using existing APIs and ASIN numbers as pickle file then converted to separate csv files. 
Since, I have not covered data cleaning in this project. I have uploaded both raw and processed files for each of the 3 product lines in the attached Data.rar file.
User can directly use the "...processed" files to run the notebook.

### Credits:
A slightly different version of this project was done by me during my master's in business analytics degree at Singapore Management University batch of 2020.
